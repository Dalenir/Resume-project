# Resume-project
THEY TOLD ME TO SHOW WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN THESE TWO MONTHS

WELL, IT'S TIME TO SHOW THEM ALL



No, srsly, its my (atm) small project for my resume.

Essentially it is postgresql database for bugtracking and (aiogram) telegram bot as main interface. '

Oh, and test documentation ofc -- it's my manual tester resume project after all! You can check it out right now: @TstTrackBot (search in telegram). In simple mode you can download test docs with /result command but if you my mentor or hr, you know the passphrase to activate main mode! Do not change my docs too much althrough, I have backups and everything, but I really do not want to restore too much.

And here test docs:

I will roll out an interactive visualization of my documentation shortly. A little later I plan to make another, more convenient interface (who would have thought that telegram bots are not ideal for creating testing artifacts).

You can also view my project report at this link: link_here.

Thank you for your time.
